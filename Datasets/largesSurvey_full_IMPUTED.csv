IRWD has always offered payment plans with terms of up to 12 months to pay for customers who are in need of financial assistance.   This offer continued with the COVID emergency.  As the dollar amount of outstanding balances increased,  IRWD began a targeted  campaign designed to reach out to customers with the largest outstanding balances. The targeted email, phone and postal mail campaign reminds customers of the offer to extend payment terms of up to 12 months with no interest, penalty charges or down payment required. This campaign has resulted in some partial payments of delinquent balances.  IRWD plans to continue this targeted campaign to its customers who are in need of financial assistance.

We are currently and have additional plans in place to work with customers to bring accounts current, including extended terms for bill repayment, the ability to accept EBT cards with cash aid benefits and a low income assistance program.

This revenue loss is in addition to the delinquency amounts that continue to accrue as the shutoff moratorium continues.  We’re offsetting these losses through use of rate stabilization funds/reserves and O&M expense reductions, but at some point this will exert pressures on future rates until there is some relief, either end moratorium by March 2021 or the state/federal government provides funding assistance, especially since the moratorium was a state mandate.

It is extremely important that any customer accumulated debt, regardless of when it was accrued, is not allowed to be forgiven or discharged.  Agencies are not in a financial position to forgive debt as rates and fees are not set to account for this.  Additionally, forgiving any debt would be a clear violation of Proposition 218 and would require some of our ratepayers to subsidize others.  It would also set a poor precedent for any future financial challenges and hardships. 

Additionally, at the point when the shutoff order is lifted, it is imperative that debt accumulated before the order was lifted and debt accumulated after the order is lifted are treated separately and distinctly.  Customers would not be shutoff for debt accumulated before the shutoff order was lifted and districts would work with those customers to establish payment plans and other repayment opportunities.  However, any debt accumulated beginning on or after the date the order is lifted would be subject to each district’s billing and collections process up to and including disconnect for non-payment.  Agencies need to be able to operate under clear rules and understanding. This benefits both the agency and customers by having well defined procedures to reference. 

RCWD also provides water service to a large number of agricultural accounts.  These accounts would be considered smaller operations than those agricultural accounts typically found in the central valley, but they do make up a significant portion of RCWD’s water sales.  Because many of these operations are small in scale and/or family owned, we have not been disconnecting service for non-payment since the governor’s shutoff order.  The financial impact of these agricultural accounts to our agency is not represented in the survey numbers.  Therefore, it’s important to highlight these accounts in order to provide a wider view of the total impact that the emergency order has created for our district.  While the survey is focused on the residential impact, there are many more factors that feed into the financial health of an agency.",NA,"Below are several examples of customers both on the Agricultural side and Residential side that are exploiting the current policies and have accumulated significant balances, in some cases several thousands of dollars per month.

I can only give you how many accounts that are delinquent at the time the report is generated. I do not have a way to give number of accounts that are more than one cycle in arrears. I can do this with some of our aging report but it only does Current, 30-60, 60-90, and 90+. With that said I am unable to fill out table 2.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"N",NA,20,"Y","Y","We have always offered payment plans. We currently are not putting anyone on a plan due to no end date to the noshut off order. Once we have an end in sight we will be proactive and send letters to customers that are 90+ days in arrears that they can sign up for a payment plan. Otherwise the rest of the accounts will be notified during the normal billing and shut off process.","Due to system limitations I am only able to run our aging report for current activity. We never tracked our delinquencies to the level the water board is requesting due to not having a large issue with delinqences. In our city customers end up paying by the time they are shut off. Since there is a no shut off order we have seen those numbers rise but not at an alarming rate. We are seeing 90+ day arrears growing and by what we beleive to be the same customers that would normally be turned off. 
Staff Notes: I did my best with the limitations of our billing software. On a side note we tend to look at our true delinquent accounts at 60+ days since this is when they would normally be shut off. 15% of our customers receive a past due notice and 8% of our customer receive a 48 hour phone call which is when they decide to pay. To me the customers that need assistance and that should be the focus of the survey are those who are the point of being turned off as the rest will still pay they just fall into arrear buckets to receive reminders until they decide to pay. The accounts that are over 90+ days for us are least likely to pay. We noticed 0-30 days and 60-90 days arrears not growing but stay steady. The arrears that are growing are 90+ days. That is where we decided to keep our focus and run citywide data reports and not the detail your survey is requesting.","Again with limitations to our aging report I am unable to break out the dollar amounts by the thresholds requested. This would take me to run the report three times for each amount and manually count the number to accounts on the report. Again, I believe this is due to our agency and probaly most historically not having a large issue with delinquent accounts. This can also just be a limitation of using older software as well.","I would like to see more surveys like this but with a broader approach to the data or even finding out what software other agencies are using. This could also help you to understand why some agencies don't respond to the surveys.","S:\EXECUTIVE\OSI\Drought Conservation\Climate & Conservation Unit\COVID-19 Survey (Nov 2020)\Completed Surveys\DISTRICT06-CA4210011-SANTAMARIAWATERDEPARTMENT.xlsx","E","y","y","n",1,1,456373,0.0119419860508838,0.0116067339654186,0.0113898061454118,0.0652667883507569,0.0607200688910168,0.0540435126530272,0.0549944891568958,0.0528011078657151,0.0495800584171281,0.0455657981519503,1,0,223,128,0.573991031390135,1.7421875,223,0.573991031390135,"A","A",1.71638666327689
