Of most concern to the system is the debt that is more than 90 day overdue, for the residential accounts this amount is $120,383.07","S:\DDW\DDW-Public\COVID-19 CWS Financial Survey\DISTRICT18-SONOMA\Complete\Survey_DISTRICT18-CA4910014-ROHNERTPARK-CITYOFcompleted.xlsx","single","94928","36",180,272,143,64,40,30,22,9,17,63,876,"Small/Medium",14.43,67171.23,37.43,4970205.06,4970205.06,261.835790943655,261.835790943655,1.50450254640667,1,1,0,0.666666666666667,"low",1,1,496668,0.00637447953159857,0.00617313779023412,0.00682548503225495,0.0770554978375897,0.0679931060587757,0.0620656051930062,0.0613850701071943,0.0592830623273495,0.0552099188995466,0.0503777171067997,6,"C1",1,0.0921620199894792,0,0,NA,76,69,55,0.907894736842105,1.10144927536232,0.907894736842105,1.49879325068965

No operational issues due to COVID; however, they have had a lot issues with delinquent accounts. Some customers are ""taking advantage"" of the situation by running up their bills knowing that the water will not be shut-off. There are also issues with residential customers moving out without paying the bill, which then would get passed on to the next owner. Rental properties are also an issue, as landlords get stuck with large water bills as well. There are a small amount of delinquent accounts that have arranged to participate in a payment plant; however, the majority of them have not reached out to start a plan.","S:\DDW\DDW-Public\COVID-19 CWS Financial Survey\DISTRICT14-SANDIEGO\Complete\Survey_DISTRICT14-CA1310006-IMPERIAL-CITYOF (Completed 11_18_2020).xlsx","single","92251","0",11,32,23,21,16,9,14,6,11,61,204,"Small/Medium",37.09,80568,26.4,7787195,3825608,244.708937249329,498.115910622126,0.942025260003957,1,4,2,2.33333333333333,"medium",1,1,191649,0.0326273552170896,0.0311976582189315,0.0316150879994156,0.0873367458217888,0.106329800833816,0.118852694248339,0.12984675109184,0.129173645570809,0.123428768216896,0.112784308814552,4,"C1",1,0.0352149145520456,0,0,NA,107,84,69,0.785046728971963,1.27380952380952,0.785046728971963,1.73333185617821

We would have between 150-200 customers who were charged a cutoff penalty of $50, not to mention the 10% late fees that we are no longer charging.  The penalties and late fees we are not collecting are budgeted to be$147,500 annually.   Utility Receivables at 10/31/20 are up 8.2% over 10/31/19 or over $72,000.  Some months in 2020 the increase over the same period in 2019 is in the high teens.  People are not paying their utility bills and we are not cutting them off or charging them any penalty.  It is not sustainable.       At 10/31/20, our water receivables balance was $102,000 BEFORE we billed for OCTOBER.  That is revenue that is NOT collected.",0,1731158,1731158,"B","N",884,293013,"Question 5.   We have a Fund Balance in our Water Fund of 9.2 m and a budgeted loss for 20/21 of 701K.  In addition, we are looking at having to pay a million dollar water line next year and we have had $80K in repairs to a well we weren't planning on this year so far.  The Fund Balance is made up of $3,894, 298 in Capital Assets, $301,400 restricted for Debt Service and the remaining $2.3 m Fund Balance for capital improvements and continuing operating costs.  It is not a lot of cushion for a system that is not collecting its billed utility charges.  

Table 2: We only have one zip code and around 4000 accounts so we're over 22% that are late at the time of this report.  That is extremely unsettling and a trend that is only getting worse the longer we are in this situation.","S:\DDW\DDW-Public\COVID-19 CWS Financial Survey\DISTRICT05-MONTEREY\Complete\Survey_DISTRICT05-CA2710011-SOLEDAD-CITYOF.xlsx","single","93960","75",167,301,144,71,28,27,14,11,11,35,884,"Small/Medium",25.04,70018.46,38.4,1731158,1731158,279.169586333443,279.169586333443,1.88821847200714,1,1,4,2,"medium",1,1,448732,0.0336169473093071,0.0335523207616127,0.0310207428933083,0.0837537773102877,0.0698345560379024,0.0613974488113172,0.0588926129627484,0.0555788310171773,0.0519486018380681,0.0505557883101718,2,"C1",1,0.223910840932118,0,0,NA,107,84,69,0.785046728971963,1.27380952380952,0.785046728971963,1.73333185617821

Under the City's lease agreement, Veolia provides all operational liquidity.  The amount reflected as unrestricted represents an amount the CIty may potentially provide for extreme COVID account distress.   #6: This answer depends.  It is difficult to attribute causation on current payment trends.  A number of customers increasingly may require financial assistance with water bills (i.e. payment plans) or, given a high degree of population mobility, may simply close accounts and leave the service area with unpaid bills - which would create stress on system finances more immediately than 12 months depending on amount of activity.  We note that historically stressed customers are adding average monthly delinquent balance of appoximately $27,000, and are also noting a widespread potential for additional residential customers to become 60+ days aged. Under the City's lease agreement, Veolia manages and carries operational liquidity.  #8: This data was pulled on 11/19/2020. Balances greater than $0 and that are 60 or more days past due were used to calculate the number of delinquent accounts and the total debt.

Thank you for discussing the COVID-19 Financial Impact Survey with me.  As agreed, we will have a phone meeting for me to collect the information on Monday the 16th.  I suspect that if the information is available, it shouldn’t take more than an hour or two.  As we discussed, the completion of the survey is mandatory.  I’m sorry for the inconvenience.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Hi Mike,
Rick asked me to follow up with you after his conversation with Ali this morning. We only have a few customers who have not paid due to COVID-19, and half of them habitually are on our shut off list for non-payment.  Rick has opted out of participating in the full survey. If you would like you can answer the survey for us with the fact that we are not impacted.

We went over the questions and don't feel comfortable giving out this information.  We haven't had any financial impact due to Covid.  We have kept our office door shut and have been taking payments through our drop-off box and have not had any delinquent payments.

Additionally, there are some customers that are taking advantage of the Governor's orders preventing water shutoff during COVID. Because Cabazon cannot threaten service terminations due to non payment, some customers have not made payments of any kind since March 2020.
